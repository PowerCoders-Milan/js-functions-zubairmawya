# Celsius Farhenheit

To convert a °C number into a °F you have to use this formula:

`°F = °C * 9/5 + 32`

We will split the code into two functions:
1. `multiplyByNineFifths(number)`, resposabile for `x * 9/5`
2. `getFahrenheit(celsius)`, that will use the return of the other function and then add 32

Use either `arrow function` or `function nameFunction()`, as you prefer.

When you see that it is working do the reverse formula, following the same principle of decomposing the operation in steps.

To conver a °F number into °C use this formula:
`°C = (°F − 32) × 5/9`
